## Purpose
When fossil fuels are burned, they emit lots of gasses into our atmosphere; specifically carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses. This causes a rise in temperatures as greenhouse gasses cause rise in temperatures globally as they trap heat in the air. This analysis will be linear as we will discover the trends/patterns between the amount of fossil fuels and their impact with temperature on a global scale from the years of 1995-2020.
