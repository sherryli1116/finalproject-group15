## Presentation 

**Topic:** When fossil fuels are burned, they emit lots of gasses into our atmosphere; specifically carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses. This causes a rise in temperatures as greenhouse gasses cause rise in temperatures globally as they trap heat in the air. This analysis will be linear as we will discover the trends/patterns between the amount of fossil fuels and their impact with temperature on a global scale from the years of 1960-2020. 

### Datasets 

We will be using two CSV files that contain our very large datasets. 

- Fossil Fuel Emissions Data: [owid-co2-data.csv](https://github.com/sherryli1116/finalproject-group15/files/9924958/owid-co2-data.csv)

- Environment Temperature Change Data: [Environment_Temperature_change_E_All_Data_NOFLAG.csv](https://github.com/sherryli1116/finalproject-group15/files/9924957/Environment_Temperature_change_E_All_Data_NOFLAG.csv)

Both datasets include the information and years we need to compelete our analysis. There is excess data we will need to clean/transform before we can actually start with our project.

### Questions we hope to answer with our analysis 

- As fossil fuel emissions increase, does global temperature increase thereafter? 

- Are different areas of the planet affected differently by emission increase?

- What years did the temperature first begin to have a significant change?
