## Presentation 

**Topic:** When fossil fuels are burned, they emit lots of gasses into our atmosphere; specifically carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses. This causes a rise in temperatures as greenhouse gasses cause rise in temperatures globally as they trap heat in the air. This analysis will be linear as we will discover the trends/patterns between the amount of fossil fuels and their impact with temperature on a global scale from the years of 1960-2020. 

We will be using two CSV files that contain our very large datasets. 

- (OWID CO2 Data)[owid-co2-data.csv](https://github.com/sherryli1116/finalproject-group15/files/9924958/owid-co2-data.csv)

- (Environment Temperature Change)[Environment_Temperature_change_E_All_Data_NOFLAG.csv](https://github.com/sherryli1116/finalproject-group15/files/9924957/Environment_Temperature_change_E_All_Data_NOFLAG.csv)
