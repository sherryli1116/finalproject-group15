## Presentation 

**Topic:** When fossil fuels are burned, they emit lots of gasses into our atmosphere; specifically carbon dioxide and greenhouse gasses. This causes a rise in temperatures as greenhouse gasses cause rise in temperatures globally as they trap heat in the air. This analysis will be linear as we will discover the trends/patterns between the amount of fossil fuels and their impact with temperature on a global scale from the years of 1995-2020. 

### Datasets 

We will be using two CSV files that contain our very large datasets. 

- Fossil Fuel Emissions Data: [owid-co2-data.csv](https://github.com/sherryli1116/finalproject-group15/files/9924958/owid-co2-data.csv)

- Environment Temperature Change Data: [Daily Temperature of Major Cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities?select=city_temperature.csv) 

Both datasets include the information and years we need to compelete our analysis. There is excess data we will need to clean/transform before we can actually start with our project. Our game plan is to create data frames after cleaning the data we want from both datasets and then combining the clean data sets for our final analysis. 

### Questions we hope to answer with our analysis 

- As fossil fuel emissions increase, does global temperature increase thereafter? 

- Are different areas of the planet affected differently by emission increase?

- What years did the temperature first begin to have a significant change?
